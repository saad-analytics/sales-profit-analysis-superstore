### Key Insights

*   **Strong Growth Trend:** Revenue increased ~242% from January to December. Q4 (Sep–Dec) is the main revenue driver.
*   **November Profit Issue:** November had the highest sales but lower profit than December due to heavy discounting and shipping costs.
*   **Furniture Problem:** Furniture generates high revenue but has extremely low profit margins (~2.5%). Some sub-categories (Tables, Bookcases) are loss-making.
*   **Technology Leads:** Phones and accessories drive both high sales and healthy profit margins.
*   **Customer Stability:** Top customers have strong profit margins (32%–47%), making them critical to long-term business stability.

### 💡 Business Recommendations

1.  **Protect Margins:** Reduce aggressive discounts during peak months.
2.  **Product Optimization:** Fix or remove loss-making furniture items (review pricing, suppliers, or shipping costs).
3.  **Strategic Focus:** Focus marketing on high-margin products (Technology, Paper, Envelopes).
4.  **Inventory Planning:** Prepare inventory early for March and Q4 demand spikes.
5.  **Acquisition Channel:** Use Office Supplies as a customer acquisition channel and cross-sell higher-value products.
